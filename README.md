# Review's Hunter

Hunt some Udacity's revision automatically ðŸ”¦ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anapaulagomes/review-hunter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anapaulagomes/review-hunter)

## How it works

This project is focused on Udacity's reviewer. Considering this, you should have an _auth token_.
Add it as environment variable with the name __UDACITY_AUTH_TOKEN__.

## Development

I've tried to develop this with TDD. So take a look on tests to follow the hunter's logic.
